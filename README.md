## RSISeg
 An interactive semantic segmentation tool for remote sensing images.

## Why do you need this tool?

Remote sensing image segmentation has long been a practical topic. Traditional fine segmentation mainly relies on meticulous manual work and expert experience. Deep learning（DL）technologies are making rapid progress in semantic segmentation. Many remote sensing scientists would like to utilize these new technologies fully. However, they are still worried that relying solely on these technologies will not achieve the same segmentation results as using their expertise. 

DL-based interactive segmentation is a good solution for balancing expert knowledge and learning machines, thus addressing this concern. Here we presented an interactive segmentation tool for remote-sensing images. 

## Access this web-based tool via (Note: this server currently uses CPU, which is relatively slow during interactions. However, the server is being upgraded and will soon be installed with GPU, which can greatly increase the interaction rate):

## How to configure it locally?
This tool consists of two parts: the front end and the back end. The back-end model has yet to be announced since it is still being trained and debugged. 

Users will be able to try to use it locally by following the configuration steps below (More details will come soon):

 Step 1.  Setting the backend connection "URL".

 Step 2. Install and configure the front-end code locally.
