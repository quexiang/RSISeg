## RSISeg
 An interactive semantic segmentation tool for remote sensing images.

## Why to use this tool?

Remote sensing image segmentation has long been a practical topic.Traditional fine segmentation mainly relies on meticulous manual work and expert experience. Deep learning（DL）technologies are making rapid progress in semantic segmentation. Many remote sensing scientists would like to utilize these new technologies fully, but they still worried that relying solely on these technologies will not achieve the same segmentation results as using their own expertise. 

DL-based interactive segmentation is a good solution for balancing the expert knowledge and learning machines, thus addressing this concern. Here we presented an interactive segmentation tool for remote-sensing images.

## How to configure it locally?
This tool consists of two parts: the front end and the back end. The back-end model has not been announced yet since it is still being trained and debugged. Users can try using the local configuration by following the following steps.

## Step 1  Setting the backend connection

## Setp 2  Install and configure nginx locally
